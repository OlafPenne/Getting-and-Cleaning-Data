# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data


This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Loads all relevant datasets
Merges the two datasets (test and train) into one
Extracts only the columns related to mean and standard dev
Gives appropriate names to the varables in the dataset
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file average_dataset.txt

The following files can be found on Github:

CodeBook.txt - describes the variables used
run.analysis.R - Script reading the files, transforming these to a tidy datafile
average_dataset.txt - output of the script. Average values per subject / Activit
